  'Eagles live within two and a half miles of the coast, bays, rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water, reflecting the availability of their main food source. They typically nest in large, mature, accessible trees, as well as cliffs and man-made structures.',
  'Philippine tarsiers are found in areas of tall grasses, bushes, bamboo shoots, and small trees in tropical rainforests. They enjoy the canopy of the jungle leaping from limb to limb. Tarsiers usually do not move using four limbs rather they have developed excellent leaping skills.',
  'Adults of most species are found in shallow, coastal waterbays lagoons and estuaries. Some also venture into the open sea. Juveniles of some species may be found in bays and estuaries as well as at sea.',
  'In the wild, water buffalo are found in tropical and subtropical forests as well as wet grasslands. They are considered terrestrial but are heavily dependent on water and spend a majority of time wallowing in rivers or mud holes.',
  'They utilize rainforest scrublands eucalyptus grove forest mangrove and open country',
  'Presently live on two Visayan islands located in the central Philippines Panay Island and Negros Island. They are found in dens, tropical rainforests',

  'Domestic dogs primarily live in areas of human habitation and are somewhat constrained to developed areas',
  'Hamsters are found throughout much of Europe and Asia. All hamsters are nocturnal, or active at night. They have terrible eyesight but their senses of smell and touch, as well as their whiskers, help them navigate.',
  'Their distribution includes Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent to the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, but no genus is found in both Africa and Asia.',
  'They live in tropical savanna forests but range widely over the islands, from beach to ridge top. Komodo dragons eat almost any kind of meat, scavenging for carcasses or stalking animals that range in size from small rodents to large water buffalo.',
  'Owls live in a variety of habitats, including coniferous forests, mountains, deserts, and plains. The snowy owl lives in the cold tundra of the north.',
  'All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater.',
